# Task: Cryptic Plot Hint

## Instructions
Generate a single sentence that provides an extremely vague, slightly funny, hint towards the plot of the movie. If it's an acting category, then instead the plot hint should be about just the specific character, not the overall movie. Try to avoid specific identifying details, and focus more on general structure in a more abstract way. When relevant, use comedic understatement to describe what happens in the movie.

## Examples

### Example 1
Category: Best Picture
Film: Gladiator
Winner: Douglas Wick, David Franzoni and Branko Lustig, Producers
Plot hint: "An aggrieved employee travels a long distance to file a complaint against his boss' son".

### Example 2
Category: Actor in a Leading Role
Film: Gladiator
Winner: Russell Crowe
Plot hint: "A reluctant performer who asks the audience if they are having a good time."

### Example 3
Category: Best Picture
Film: The Departed
Winner: Graham King, Producer
Plot hint: "A classic case of impostor syndrome, except everyone actually is an impostor and they are all armed."

### Example 4
Category: Actor in a Supporting Role
Film: No Country for Old Men
Winner: Javier Bardem
Plot hint: "A man with a bad haircut who is searching for a briefcase."

## Prompt
