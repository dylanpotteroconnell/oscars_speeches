It doesn't come out in slow motion, but it doesn't really ring a bell--the name.  I didn't know my name when you said that.  This Adrien?  Okay.\n\r\nI haven't really written a speech because every time I wrote a speech for the past one of these things I didn't win.  But, you know, there comes a time in life when everything seems to make sense and this is not one of those times. What I do know, though, is that I've never felt this much love and encouragement from my peers and from people I admire and from complete strangers. And it means a great deal to me.  And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.\n\r\nI have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement.  And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.\n\r\nWhat can I say?  This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman.

But what we had was a script that inspired mad love in everyone who read it.  We had a genius for a director.  We had a cast and a crew who were unwavering in their commitment and whose talents are up on the screen for all of you to see.  We had partners in Film4, in Celador, in Pathé and Fox Searchlight who had the courage to support us.  And we had a shared love for the extraordinary city of Mumbai where we made the movie.  Most of all we had passion and we had belief.  And our film shows that if you have those two things, truly anything is possible.  I want to thank, on a personal note, my mum and my dad for all their love and support over the years.  I want to thank my girl, Saskia Mulder, who is my partner in crime and the light in my life. And I want to thank all of you very much indeed.  Thank you.",

I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.\n\nThere's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, \"When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.\"\n\nTo my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.\n\nAnd to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, \"Who's your hero?\" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, \"Who's your hero?\" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, \"So, are you a hero?\" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, \"Why?\" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.\n\nSo to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'.
