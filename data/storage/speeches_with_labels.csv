I could not be standing here without that undying love that was just sung about by, not Bruce [Springsteen], but Neil Young.  And I have that in a lover that is so close to fine, we should all be able to experience such heaven right here on earth.  I know also that, I should not be doing this, I should not be here, but I am because of the union of such filmmakers as Ed Saxon, Ron Nyswaner, Kristi Zea, Tak Fujimoto, Jonathan Demme -- who seems to have these [referring to the Oscar] attached to his limbs for every actor that works with him of late.  And a cast that includes Antonio Banderas, who, second to my lover, is the only person I would trade for.  And a cast that includes many other people, but the actor who really put his film image at risk, and shone because of his integrity, Mr. Denzel Washington, who I really must share this with.

I would not be standing here if it weren't for two very important men in my life, so... two that I haven't spoken with in awhile, but I had the pleasure of just the other evening.  Mr. Rawley Farnsworth, who was my high school drama teacher, who taught me to act well the part, there all the glory lies. And one of my classmates under Mr. Farnsworth, Mr. John Gilkerson.  I mention their names because they are two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with, to fall under their inspiration at such a young age.  I wish my babies could have the same sort of teacher, the same sort of friends.

And there lies my dilemma here tonight.  I know that my work in this case is magnified by the fact that the streets of heaven are too crowded with angels. We know their names.  They number a thousand for each one of the red ribbons that we wear here tonight.  They finally rest in the warm embrace of the gracious creator of us all.  A healing embrace that cools their fevers, that clears their skin, and allows their eyes to see the simple, self-evident, common sense truth that is made manifest by the benevolent creator of us all and was written down on paper by wise men, tolerant men, in the city of Philadelphia two hundred years ago.

I think Jon saw ""Shine"" too many times.  He thanked everybody and did everything I was going to say.

And I'm grateful every day to get to be a part of that magic and a practitioner in it, and I love it.  And tonight has been such a great celebration for us.  And it seems to somehow express this strange wave that's happened with ""Titanic,"" where people all over the world have opened their hearts to this movie.  And that's so gratifying to all of us that worked on it and we'll be forever grateful to them, the audience, and I know a lot of you are watching at home.

In the midst of all this euphoria, it's kind of hard for us to remember that this euphoria and the success is for a film that's based on a real event that happened, where real people died, that shocked the world in 1912.  So I'd just like everybody to go with me just for a second on something here.  I'd like to do a few seconds of silence in remembrance of the 1,500 men, women and children who died when the great ship died.  The message of ""Titanic"" of course is, that if the great ship can sink, the unthinkable can happen, the future is unknowable, the only thing that we truly own is today.  Life is precious.  So during these few seconds I'd like you to also listen to the beating of your own heart which is the most precious thing in the world.

What I do know, though, is that I've never felt this much love and encouragement from my peers and from people I admire and from complete strangers. And it means a great deal to me. And if it weren't for the insomnia and those sudden panic attacks, this has been an amazing, amazing journey.

I have to thank--they're already flashing time's up--I have to thank my mother and father, most importantly, for all the creativity and the encouragement. And they've been just... real strength. They've given me a great deal of strength.

What can I say? This film would not be possible without the blueprint provided by Wladyslaw Szpilman. And this is a tribute to his survival. I'd like to thank [REDACT: Roman Polanski] for the role of a lifetime. And for those of you who have seen the film and sat through the credits, you know there are just too many people to thank individually. I would not be here without all their efforts. And I thank them. And everyone worked extremely hard to make this film. And I have to thank Focus Features for getting us out there. To my longtime friend, manager, agent, consigliere, Joanne Colonna. Everybody at The Firm, PMK/HBH. And you know...[music plays]. Wait one second. One second, please, one second. Cut it out, cut it out. I get one shot at this. I'm sorry. I didn't say more than five names I don't think, but...

This is, you know, it fills me with great joy, but I am also filled with a lot of sadness tonight because I'm accepting an award at such a strange time. And, you know, my experiences in making this film made me very aware of the sadness and the dehumanization of people at times of war, and the repercussions of war. And whomever you believe in, if it's God or Allah, may He watch over you. And let's pray for a peaceful and swift resolution. Thank you. And I have a friend from Queens who's a soldier in Kuwait right now, Tommy Zarabinski. And I hope you and your boys make it back real soon. God bless you, guys. I love you. Thank you very much.""""""",4

It was just there when I needed it to be there and the actors were just doing such a wonderful job. I just want to thank two very special people that when I was eight years old I made films at home on a Super-8 camera that my mum and dad had bought for me. And they supported me all through the years. And they died in the last few years; they didn't see these films made. So for Bill and Joan, thank you.""""""",4

I can't wait – and listen, he's had a wonderful story and I can't wait to see the next chapter of his story, you know? If you wanna, if you wanna be a champ, if you wanna get trained with him, go meet with him. Dickeklund.com. Go do it. Check him out, okay. Alright. He deserves it.

Our producers: Mark, David, Todd, incredible. Relativity and Paramount, for just pushing this out there and letting people know it exists. So many movies are just brilliant but nobody ever knows about them, you know? So we're so lucky to be here tonight and have people recognize that. My team, led by Patrick and Boomer and Carlos and Jen and Anna and Julie, thank you so much for everything you do. And of course, mostly, my wonderful wife...

Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you to the Academy for this, all six thousand members. Thank you to the other nominees. All these performances were impeccable in my opinion; I didn't see a false note anywhere. I want to thank Jean-Marc Vallée, our director. I want to thank Jared Leto and Jennifer Garner, who I worked with daily.

There's a few things, about three things, to my account that I need each day. One of 'em is something to look up to. Another is something to look forward to. And another is someone to chase. Now, first off, I want to thank God, 'cause that's who I look up to. He has graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand. He has shown me that it's a scientific fact that gratitude reciprocates. In the words of the late Charlie Laughton*, who said, ""When you've got God, you've got a friend. And that friend is you.""

To my family, that's who and what I look forward to. To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo. He's got a lemon meringue pie over there. He's probably in his underwear and he's got a cold can of Miller Lite. And he's dancin' right now. To you, Dad, you taught me what it means to be a man. To my mother who's here tonight, who taught me and my two older brothers – demanded – that we respect ourselves, and what we in turn learned was then we were better able to respect others. Thank you for that, Mama. To my wife Camila and my kids, Levi, Vida and Mr. Stone, the courage and significance you give me every day I go out the door is unparalleled. You are the four people in my life that I want to make the most proud of me. Thank you.

And to my hero; that's who I chase. Now, when I was 15 years old I had a very important person in my life come to me and say, ""Who's your hero?"" And I said, I don't know; I gotta think about that. Give me a couple of weeks. I come back two weeks later, this person comes up and says, ""Who's your hero?"" I said, I thought about it. You know who it is? I said, it's me in 10 years. So I turned 25; ten years later that same person comes to me and goes, ""So, are you a hero?"" And I was like, not even close! No, no, no. She said, ""Why?"" I said, because my hero's me at 35. So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero's always 10 years away. I'm never gonna be my hero. I'm not gonna attain that; I know I'm not. And that's just fine with me, because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasin'.

So to any of us, whatever those things are: whatever it is we look up to, whatever it is we look forward to, and whoever it is we're chasin'. To that I say: Amen. To that I say: Alright, alright, alright. To that I say: Just keep livin'. Thank you.",3,"""""""To my father, who I know is up there right now with a big pot of gumbo.

We want to thank our incredible cast: Emma, Naomi, Andrea, Amy, Lindsay, Mr. Norton, Zach and the maestro of maestros, Mr. Michael Keaton – woof – for making this film fly. Without you guys we would not be here. James Skotchdopole, John Lesher, the producers. And I want to thank, too, obviously, the great support from Arnon Milchan, Brad Weston from New Regency and all the team on Fox Searchlight, Nancy Utley – god, um, um, um, um – Claudia Lewis and Steve Gilula and all the people to help us.

Thank you. Thank you all so very much. Thank you to the Academy. Thank you to all of you in this room. I have to congratulate the other incredible nominees this year for their unbelievable performances. ""The Revenant"" was a product of the tireless efforts of an unbelievable cast and crew I got to work alongside. First off, to my brother in this endeavor, Mr. Tom Hardy. Tom, your fierce talent on screen can only be surpassed by your friendship off screen. To Mr. Alejandro Iñárritu, as the history of cinema unfolds you have forged your way into history these past two years. What an unbelievable talent you are. Thank you to you and Chivo for creating a transcendent cinematic experience for all of us. Thank you to everybody at Fox and New Regency, in particular Arnon Milchan. You were the champion of this endeavor. My entire team.  I have to thank everyone from the very onset of my career. Mr. Caton-Jones, for casting me in my first film. Mr. Scorsese, for teaching me so much about the cinematic art form. To Mr. Rick Yorn, thank you for helping me navigate my way through this industry. And to my parents, none of this would be possible without you. And to my friends, I love you dearly; you know who you are.

And lastly, I just want to say this. Making ""The Revenant"" was about man's relationship to the natural world, a world that we collectively felt in 2015 as the hottest year in recorded history. Our production needed to move to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow. Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species and we need to work collectively together and stop procrastinating. We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations, but who speak for all of humanity. For the indigenous people of the world. For the billions and billions of underprivileged people who will be most affected by this. For our children's children. And for those people out there whose voices have been drowned out by the politics of greed. I thank you all for this amazing award tonight. Let us not take this planet for granted.

There was a time when I thought this movie was impossible because I couldn't bring it to fruition, I couldn't bring myself to tell another story. And so everybody behind me on this stage said, no, that is not acceptable. So I just want to thank everybody up here behind me. Everybody out there in that room – because we didn't do this, you guys chose us. Thank you for the choice. I appreciate it. Much love.

JEREMY KLEINER:
Good night. Thank you so much.

[REDACT: JIMMY KIMMEL]:
Well, I don't know what happened. I blame myself for this. Let's remember, it's just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed but the good news is we got to see some extra speeches. We have some great movies. I knew I would screw this show up, I really did. Thank you for watching. I'm back to work tomorrow night on my regular show. I promise I'll never come back. Good night.""""""",5

Amen, brother. I just want to echo everything you just said and all those thanks.
